# Banking-System

Bank management System is a project I made for my final project of grade 11 (this probably explains why it is so basic). I am only pushing this now because I wasn't aware of github back then. 

Since this was a pretty beginner project, I did not use any database or files to store customer information. The information stayed in the memory only till the program was running.
