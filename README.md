# Banking-System

Bank management System is a project I made for my final project of grade 11. I am only pushing this now because I wasn't aware of github back then. 

This is a basic bank management project which includes the following:
  1. Creates a bank account
  2. Deletes an account
  3. Modifies an account (address, phone numbers, etc) 
  4. Updates balance after withdrawal and deposits
  5. Checking balance
  
This projects inclides the following concepts (pretty basic ans beginner level concept I learnt till that point of time):
  1. Structs (now, I would replace those with class)
  2. Function creation and calling
  3. Switch case
  4. Basic menu creation

Since this was a pretty beginner project, I did not use any database or files to store customer information. The information stayed in the memory only till the program was running.
